I am Ayush Ravindra Vaidande, an ambitious Deep Learning Engineer holding a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with honors. My academic journey at Shivajirao Jondhale College of Engineering has been enriched by hands-on experience in various projects spanning Deep Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and other AI domains. Proficient in Python and C++, I possess a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of AI.

Throughout my academic pursuits, I engaged in internships in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Python, refining my skills and gaining valuable industry exposure. My fervent interest in large language models culminated in my final year project, where I successfully developed a Fine-tuned Llama 2 7B with Therapy Dataset. This project not only showcased my proficiency but also highlighted my commitment to pushing the boundaries of language modeling.

Passionate about the confluence of technology and language, I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting, contributing to innovative projects and advancing my expertise in the realm of Deep Learning and AI. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage my experience and contribute to the development of Large Language Models as an integral member of your team.
